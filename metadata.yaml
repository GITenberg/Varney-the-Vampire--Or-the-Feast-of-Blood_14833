description: "Varney the Vampire; or, the Feast of Blood is a Victorian era serialized\
  \ gothic horror story variously attributed to James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett\
  \ Prest. It first appeared in 1845–1847 as a series of weekly cheap pamphlets of\
  \ the kind then known as \"penny dreadfuls\". The story was published in book form\
  \ in 1847. It is of epic length: the original edition ran to 876 double-columned\
  \ pages  and 232 chapters. Altogether it totals nearly 667,000 words.\nDespite its\
  \ inconsistencies, Varney the Vampire is more or less a cohesive whole. It is the\
  \ tale of the vampire Sir Francis Varney, and introduced many of the tropes present\
  \ in vampire fiction recognizable to modern audiences. It was the first story to\
  \ refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire, noting “With a plunge he seizes her neck\
  \ in his fang-like teeth.”\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
